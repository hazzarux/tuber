This a simple project, I maintained in my free time.
It's actually pretty good if you want popular (& recent) music on your iPod.
I use it to get all the YouTube links at [1]. (with Python)
Afterwards I download the links with youtube-dl (with my bash script)
I'm also converting all .flv files to .mp3 for reducing the file size & for easy transfer on my iPod. But that is optional.
